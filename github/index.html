	<h2>Dear Git Hub,</h2>
	<section>
		<p>Who are we kidding? We spent the last 3 years as friends, but I always knew we were something more. Don't you think it's time we got to know each other a little better?</p>

		<p>After all, you're amazing! You're a free platform that can host any and every coding project I attempt, in a way that open sources that code and allows the world to benefit from my work. All I need to do is (push) my code to your server, and (pull) it back to my computer, both of which are so easy through your beautiful Desktop App. So perfect, yet so humble; you astound me every day.</p>

		<p>And best of all, once I push my code online, you allow me and other developers to work on the code simultaneously, carefully regulating our work to make sure that we are all aware of the changes made by others. You support (branch)ing projects, allowing me to test out experimental code and (merge) it back in once it's functional. Or if I want to take the project a totally new direction, I can simply (fork) the project, never to merge back with the original.</p>

		<p>So what do you say? Wanna go out with me sometime?</p>

		<p>( ) Yes     ( ) No</p>

		<p>Yours either way,</p>
		<p>Ari Klebanov</p>
